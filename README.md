#### Backstory
While exploring, you realised you were lost. With the night coming and the monsters howling, you needed a place to hide, so you crawled into a hole and fell asleep.
\* \* \* \* \*
You wake up in pitch black. You light your lantern and discover that you're in a cave. You look around for a way out, but the exit had caved in. Realising that you're trapped, you begin you expedition looking for an escape.
